    <h2>Superhero</h2>
    <hr>
    <br><em>For other uses, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero_(disambiguation)" target="_blank">Superhero (disambiguation).</a></em>
    <p>A superhero (sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero) is a type of heroic stock character who possesses supernatural
        or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the public, and usually battling supervillains.
        A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine (also rendered super-heroine or super heroine), although the
        word superhero is commonly used for females also. Superhero fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such
        characters, especially in American comic books since the 1930s. By most definitions, characters do not require actual
        superhuman powers or phenomena to be deemed superheroes.[1][2][3] While the Dictionary.com definition of "superhero"
        is "a figure, especially in a comic strip or cartoon, endowed with superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting
        evil or crime",[4] the longstanding Merriam-Webster dictionary gives the definition as "a fictional hero having extraordinary
        or superhuman powers; also: an exceptionally skillful or successful person".[5] Terms such as masked crime fighters,
        costumed adventurers or masked vigilantes are sometimes used to refer to characters such as the Spirit, who may not
        be explicitly referred to as superheroes but nevertheless share similar traits. Some superheroes use their powers
        to counter daily crime while also combating threats against humanity from supervillains, who are their criminal counterparts.
        Often at least one of these supervillains will be the superhero's archenemy. Some long-running superheroes such as
        Batman, Spider-Man, Superman, Captain America, Wonder Woman, Iron Man, the Flash, Wolverine, Green Lantern, and Hulk
        have a rogues gallery of many villains.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <h4><b>Early history[edit]</b></h4>
    </p>
    The word 'superhero' dates to at least 1917.[6] Antecedents of the archetype include such folkloric heroes as Robin Hood,
    who adventured in distinctive clothing.[7] The 1903 play The Scarlet Pimpernel and its spinoffs popularized the idea
    of a masked avenger and the superhero trope of a secret identity.[7] Shortly afterward, masked and costumed pulp fiction
    characters such as Zorro (1919), The Shadow (1930) and comic strip heroes, such as the Phantom (1936) began appearing,
    as did non-costumed characters with super strength, including Patoruzú (1928), the comic-strip character Popeye (1929)
    and novelist Philip Wylie's protagonist Hugo Danner (1930).[8]</p>
    <p>
    In the 1930s, both trends came together in some of the earliest superpowered costumed heroes such as Japan's Ōgon Bat[9][10] (visualized in painted panels used by kamishibai
    oral storytellers in Japan since 1931), Mandrake the Magician[11][12][13] (1934), Superman in 1938 and Captain Marvel
    (1939) at the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books. 1940s[edit]</p>
    <p>
        <h4 id="section-a"><strong>1940s</strong></h4>
    </p>
    <p>During the 1940s there were many superheroes: The Flash, Green Lantern and Blue Beetle debuted in this era. This era
        saw the debut of first known female superhero, writer-artist Fletcher Hanks's character Fantomah, an ageless ancient
        Egyptian woman in the modern day who could transform into a skull-faced creature with superpowers to fight evil;
        she debuted in Fiction House's Jungle Comics #2 (Feb. 1940), credited to the pseudonymous "Barclay Flagg".[14][15]
        The Invisible Scarlet O'Neil, a non-costumed character who fought crime and wartime saboteurs using the superpower
        of invisibility created by Russell Stamm, would debut in the eponymous syndicated newspaper comic strip a few months
        later on June 3, 1940.[16] 
    </p>

        One superpowered character was portrayed as an antiheroine, a rarity for its time: the
        Black Widow, a costumed emissary of Satan who killed evildoers in order to send them to Hell — debuted in Mystic
        Comics #4 (Aug. 1940), from Timely Comics, the 1940s predecessor of Marvel Comics. Most of the other female costumed
        crime-fighters during this era lacked superpowers. Notable characters include The Woman in Red,[17][18] introduced
        in Standard Comics' Thrilling Comics #2 (March 1940); Lady Luck, debuting in the Sunday-newspaper comic-book insert
        The Spirit Section June 2, 1940; the comedic character Red Tornado, debuting in All-American Comics #20 (Nov 1940);
        Miss Fury,[19] debuting in the eponymous comic strip by female cartoonist Tarpé Mills on April 6, 1941; the Phantom
        Lady, introduced in Quality Comics Police Comics #1 (Aug. 1941); the Black Cat,[20][21] introduced in Harvey Comics'
        Pocket Comics #1 (also Aug. 1941); and the Black Canary, introduced in Flash Comics #86 (Aug. 1947) as a supporting
        character.[22] The most iconic comic book superheroine, who debuted during the Golden Age, is Wonder Woman.[23] Modeled
        from the myth of the Amazons of Greek mythology, she was created by psychologist William Moulton Marston, with help
        and inspiration from his wife Elizabeth and their mutual lover Olive Byrne.[24][25] Wonder Woman's first appearance
        was in All Star Comics #8 (Dec. 1941), published by All-American Publications, one of two companies that would merge
        to form DC Comics in 1944.</p>
